# EDR Enforcement

A member of the Clubs and Socs office reached out to the Redbrick Committee on 2024-07-05 informing them that ISS requests that Redbrick install the EDR solution previously laid out on the Redbrick Servers. They informed the committee that if Redbrick did not engage with ISS on this matter that all services on the network would be blocked. On the same day ISS also reached out with a form of Redbrick's current network assets requesting it be filled out promptly.

The Redbrick Admin's Proceeded to reach back out to ISS requesting clarification on the reasoning for this new shift to enforced compliance with their new EDR solution. They were informed that the entire University has transitioned to this new EDR solution and that these cyber security controls were to be a condition of network access moving forward. Seeking more clarification on the matter the admins and ISS scheduled a meeting to discuss this further.

# Meeting With ISS

All 3 of the Redbrick admins and 3 members of the ISS Cyber security team had a meeting on the 2024-07-29 about compliance with this new mandate by ISS. The exact minutes of this meeting will be made available at a later date.
