Every year, Clubs and Socs hold a ball to show off the work done by students during the year. This is a great way to round out the year and is usually a great night.

Every society gets at least two free tickets, and Redbrick offers those tickets to the nominees for the "Individual Contribution to Society Life" award. If there is any more tickets given to the society, they should be raffled off to the interested committee members.

To be included in the raffle, an expression of interest is all that is needed, however should you feel you can make your own way there (pay for the ticket yourself) without too much financial worry, then you might consider not including your name in the draw to ensure everyone has a fair chance to attend the event.

This same method of honour should be applied to any other event in which free tickets are offered and need to be raffled off (Computing Societies Ball, conferences, etc).
