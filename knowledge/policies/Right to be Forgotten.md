Every member of the society has the right to be forgotten. This means that when referencing committee members in minutes, communications documented in this repository, and any other public place, their position on the committee shall be referenced in place of their username.

For example, if a user `john` is [Chairperson](../../committee/Chairperson.md), they should be referenced by their position, `chair`.

If a decision is reached by the committee, either by consensus or by a vote, the committee shall be referenced as a whole.

## Examples

- `chair` suggested a new meeting time.

- `events` proposed a new event involving water balloons

- `committee` agreed to grant honorary membership to a member.
