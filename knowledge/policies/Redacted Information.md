Some information should not be made public knowledge, for reasons including but not limited to:

- GDPR
- Sensitivity of the matter

In this case, the minutes may reference that a discussion occurred, but not what that discussion was about. This ensures confidentiality while also providing a public record of the discussion occurring.

A resolution should always be placed after the redacted information.

## Examples

- Discussion about [Redacted Information](Redacted%20Information.md).
	- Resolution was reached by committee.

- [Redacted Information](Redacted%20Information.md) was brought up
	- More discussion required, `chair` to discuss further with relevant parties.
