Redbrick has never required the support of sponsorship from companies or others to survive. We get enough support from "once-off" events with companies, speakers and Clubs & Societies. That is not to say that companies cannot sponsor a single event, it just cannot include other obligations such as non-compete clauses or logo placements etc.

The idea behind this decision is that, as Redbrick is a student society run by volunteers, nobody should be bound to a signature on a contract. This allows events to run with contributions to the society, without tying the society to a company.
