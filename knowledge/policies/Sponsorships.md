Redbrick up to now has never needed the support of sponsorship from companies or others to survive. We get enough support from "one shot" events with companies, speakers and Clubs & Socs. That is not to say that companies cannot sponsor a single event, it just cannot be include other obligations (like social media posts).

The idea behind this decision is that, as Redbrick is a student society run by volunteers, nobody should be bound to a signature on a contract. This allows events to run with contributions to the society, but not tie the society to a company.
