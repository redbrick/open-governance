In case of ambiguity, Redbrick's constitution shall supersede any rules set out by any subgroup.

Should Redbrick's constitution not clarify the ambiguity, the [Society Life Committee](../student%20life/Society%20Life%20Committee.md) constitution shall be followed. Escalation beyond this point should be followed as laid out in the [Society Life Committee](../knowledge/student%20life%20terms/Society%20Life%20Committee.md) constitution.
