# Tagging
Every year, a "tagging ceremony" will take place directly after a meeting of the general membership. During this ceremony the open governance repo will be tagged with a GPG key on behalf of Redbrick. This key will have been signed by at least 2 members of the committee and the tagging will be witnessed by at least 2 members of the general membership. This tag will be on the commit approved by the general membership of the society at the meeting of the general membership. 

You can view the technical documentation for this entire procedure on [docs.redbrick.dcu.ie](https://docs.redbrick.dcu.ie/procedures/Open-Governance-Tagging/).
