Every year, a "tagging ceremony" will take place. This will GPG sign the git tag on the repository. A HSM can be used to sign the commit, the witnesses from committee can be marked as contributors with username (for example `~user`) and any two other ordinary members of the society can be used as witnesses and added as reviewers (for example `~user`).

This will be an event which takes place once the changes have been ratified by the general membership at an AGM or EGM.
