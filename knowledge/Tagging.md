# Tagging
Every year, a "tagging ceremony" will take place directly after a meeting of the general membership. During this ceremony, the open governance repo will be tagged with a GPG key on behalf of Redbrick. This key will have been signed by at least 2 members of the committee and the tagging will be witnessed by at least 2 members of the general membership. The tag will be on the commit approved by the general membership of the society at the meeting beforehand. The witnesses from the committee are marked as contributors with usernames (for example `~user`) and any two other ordinary members of the society can be used as witnesses and added as reviewers (for example `~user`).

You can view the technical documentation for this entire procedure on [docs.redbrick.dcu.ie](https://docs.redbrick.dcu.ie/procedures/Open-Governance-Tagging/).
