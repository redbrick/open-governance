A **living document**, also known as an **evergreen document** or **dynamic document**, is a [document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document "Document") that is continually edited and updated. An example of a living document is an article in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia "Wikipedia"), an online encyclopaedia that permits anyone to freely edit its articles; this is in contrast to "dead" or "static" documents, such as an article in a single edition of the _[Encyclopædia Britannica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica "Encyclopædia Britannica")_.

A living document may or may not have a framework for updates, changes, or adjustments.

However, a living document may evolve through successive updates, be expanded as needed, and serve a different purpose over time. Living documents are changed through revisions that may or may not reference previous iterative changes.
