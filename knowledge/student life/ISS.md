# ISS

ISS is DCU's Technical Department. They handle everything from general network access to managing the student and lecturer email addresses, to managing the audio/visual equipment in all the rooms in the University.

## Escalation Policy

When an issue is flagged by ISS to the admins via email or other methods, the admins are obliged to investigate it. Redbrick is a component of the University and as such, is expected to conform to University security best practices.
