## Open Governance

Alongside the duties mandated in the constitution, the Committee should undertake guidelines laid out in this set of open governance documentation. The usefulness of this documentation only grows with each contribution made, and really shines when a role can be amended (within the bounds of the constitution) without the need for an AGM/EGM, though the changes must still be ratified by simple majority at the next valid and quorate annual or extraordinary general meeting.
