- ## Points of Discusion:
    - hoodies
        - form has been sent out
    
    - blueblock hoodies
        - advertised as same as rb hoodie, but blue
        - can get it changed (zipper)
        - hoodies same as previous years
        - could email all blueblock list
        - options are, rb hoodie but blue, or hoodie with no zip
