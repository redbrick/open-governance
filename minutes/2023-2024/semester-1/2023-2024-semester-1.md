                - `sysadmin` would love it, but we can't really unifiy it
                - can't really do it with wiki, how it operates

                - gitified markdown approach, fine for websites, not feasable for wiki
                - queries against database is not something we want to do frequently
                - throw wikimedia database somewhere

            - funded by faculty, school of engineering, ece, computing
            - tv won't be paid for
            - faculty tends to throw out tvs, if they get one, it's ours
                
- ## Points of Discusion:
    - hoodies
        - form has been sent out
    
    - blueblock hoodies
        - advertised as same as rb hoodie, but blue
        - can get it changed (zipper)
        - hoodies same as previous years
        - could email all blueblock list
        - options are, rb hoodie but blue, or hoodie with no zip
