## Retrospective

### `chair`

- :green_heart: We had almost no mishaps with `events` that we ran, everything appeared mostly smooth! GG `events`!
- :green_heart: `gdo` and `pro` were locked in, big thanks there. Socials look great!
- :green_heart: Money is hard, but `treasurer` did a lot of work to make sure it was mostly on track, especially because they're in 3rd year
- :green_heart: `sysadmin` put in stupid amounts of work to get Redbrick more secure than it has ever been
- :green_heart: I almost forgot about `helpdesk`, but that's because there have been no problems. Super smooth ride folks, and I hear a good retention rate!
- :broken_heart: Fosdem - let's aim to not have this happen again
- :broken_heart: Engsoc conflicts are bad for everyone involved. Let's try and be more tolerable of how they work around problems and make decisions, but make sure that we don't let them walk over us
- :broken_heart:/:green_heart: Some people are doing loads, some people are doing less, we are a committee, and there's 17 of us for a reason, let's try our best to spread the load out a little more, Redbrick should not be the reason you fail a module (or two in my case) in college.
- :broken_heart:/:green_heart: When we have communication, things go super smoothly, which we saw, but because there's 17 of us, sometimes it can break down. Nobody ever got hurt by having too much information.
- :broken_heart: Panic should never be the first port of call after something goes wrong, take a breath and think about the next step and who you need to contact to get that next step.

### `helpdesk`

- most hackerclubs went smooth - gj `helpdesk`
- overall good attendance and interactions, got some good feedback from first years

### `gdo`
- :smiley_cat: everyone is enjoying `events` and still showing up to hackerclub
- :smiley_cat: `chair` keeping meetings short
- :smiley_cat: strong committee attendance at meetings (unlike last year 🫣 )
- :smiley_cat: newsletters be looking good
- :smiley_cat: `vice-chair` trying their best
- :crying_cat_face: i stole `secretary` cats
- :crying_cat_face: more committee attendance needed at `events`
- :crying_cat_face: need more of a schedule.. a lot of last minute work +1 @`chair`
- :crying_cat_face: gots to keep minimal society conflicts +1 @`chair`

### `events`
- :heart: Been mostly good, pizza has been a win
- :heart: Solid regular audience
- :heart: Brickbowl went smoothly
- :heart: `treasurer` has been great, thanks `treasurer`
- :heart: Socials have been awesome
- :heart: Common room has been a great way to maintain interest and is a great resource in itself
- :broken_heart: No FOSDEM, really sorry, but we Ball
- :broken_heart: Sorry for late notice `secretary`, I'm trying


### `sysadmin`
- :heart: the commitee as a whole, `events`, PRO and GDO did a great job promoting redbrick on socials and with `events` like brick the planet +1 @`chair`
- :green_heart: `helpdesk` did a great job with hackerclub, especially keeping it relevant and entertaining to first years. Great attendance so far, lets keep it up!
- :blue_heart: `webmaster` has done a lot of great work researching, organising and putting structures in place for both the webgroup and website. Though the work done so far may not be easily visible let's make sure we document it and keep the ball rolling!
- 😢 communication has been a challenge at some times in the committee but despite this we've managed to work through it. Let's try to keep each other up to date with what's going on to minimise these challenges going forward. +1 @`chair`

### `secretary`

- :heart: Events have run smoothly with minimal issues
- :heart: Non academic `events` worked well - Brickbowl
- :heart: Committee have been great and everyone getting on well working together
- :crying_cat_face: Gathering last minute info for the newsletters, sometimes we were planning `events` on Saturday/Sunday
- :crying_cat_face: No FOSDEM - next year we do it



### `pro`
- :heart: (repeat from anon. retrospect form) Committee has been golden throughout the semester. I gotta give credit to all of the members for all of their help!
- :heart: Events for the most part have gone well with little-to-none problems. Aside from the original games night being derailed due to a lack of communication, everything else ran smooth as butter. Hackerclubs were grand! `secretary` hit the nail on the head with noting external `events` and how well they've gone!
- :broken_heart: FOSDEM. Already noted by `chair`. Don't need to repeat it. Not just the travel problem, but also the same sentence(s), word for word.
- :broken_heart: Biggest problem that I noted throughout the problem, noted earlier, but I feel that communication is the underlying issue that's within the committee. Little bit unbalanced with three of the same voices continually being seen, with other voices being called upon for their respective roles rather than a diverse and varied output. Namely in decision making.

### `treasurer`
- :heart: much nicer time on committee this year compared to previous
- :heart: very understanding cmt
- :heart: good teamwork :>>
- :heart: extremely good communication
- :broken_heart: bank do be banking 
- :broken_heart: some `treasurer` stuff only `chair`, `events` and myself knows - so i could work on transparency with the rest of the cmt
- 

### `ordinary-member`

- Communication is pretty key but i think multple folks have said that alredy

- :wink:If you need me to do anything just LMK!
- :neutral_face: Common room seems to be v tense point of talking. Can we take it easy? 
- :+1: Hackerclub was awesome, `events` were great to be a part of
- :smile: Its been a pleasure! Great sem IMO. 


### `helpdesk`
- :heart: Hackerclub had a good reception last sem, might try to make things more interactive this semester as topics get more interesting

### `webmaster`

- :heart: Events have been stellar (except for one iirc) and the committee has a proper system in place that works, which is a massive improvement from last year. MAJOR props to our Events Officers, GDO and PRO! :+1:
- :heart: Hackerclubs have seen the most improvement in my humble opinion, they strike the balance between being relevant for first year academics and entertainment for everyone. Great job Helpdesk!
- :heart: `sysadmin`, they have done a solid job with maintaining the services, migrating over to aperture and defining requirements and risks for services in the future. I have appreciated our chats about Redbrick.
- :heart: Newletters and finance have been timely and reliable, very proud of our Secretary and Treasurer!
- :heart: `chair` has put a lot of effort into Redbrick, and ensuring it will thrive after they (and I) are gone.
- :broken_heart: While communication has improved tenfold from last year, there is always room for improvement.
- :broken_heart: No FOSDEM...

# Minutes: 

> Started at: `18:05`
> Does Committee agree on last weeks minutes: `yes`


- ## Points of Info:
    - ### Chair Update:
        - next week - retrospective
        - Sponsorship Update:
            -  talk about sponsorship during the week
            -  rb hasn't accepted it in the past, didn't need it, contracts obligations etc, can be complicated
            -  associates and rootholder donations
            -  250+ a year *membership fee*
            -  c&S give all the money we need, don't get money refused
            -  not prizes (paypal and associate money can fund)
            -  can put into open gov, descicon made on for or againts
            -  pot noodle sponsorship, `chair` against the idea
            -  what redbrick have to do in return, someone has to sign, society voluntary, person who signed deal could be gone, issues can continue
            -  decicions from this years committee should not go into next years
            - C&S allow sponsorships
            - Sponsorship (Long term deal rather than single `events`)
            - Duration of contract possible to link when person who signed's duration
            - If person resigns/leaves, what happens
            - Would need to bring up all issues with pot noodle/sponsors, might say it's too much work
            - What benefit would sponsorships give us that we don't already have?
            - Sponsorship agreement could have both logos on it
            - DCU Investing Society Setup with SMF
            - Logo beside or just a company doing stuff
            - Could be issues around buying equipment from competitors if sponsored
            - Is there a need for us to decide now?
            - Added to agenda to encourage a doc about why/why not doing sponsorships
            - need to consider what they bring to the table
            - publicity, would they promote redbrick as part of the agreement (very unlikely, companies don't care about student societies outside of hiring)
            - could create issues if we sponsored from arista for example when running 2k games
            - would be nice to get money no strings attached
            - could look case by case
            - could go looking for sponsorships if needed
            - netsoc - sig, trinity - 4 sponsors
            - redbrick has done standing on it's own to date
            - rules: no contracts (difficult to do for yearly commitment)
            - logos could look tacky
            - main concern: redbrick it's own brand, not dcu networking society, would have to be proud of company to stick on it, issues of companies can affect reputation
            - delaying until later
        - pwc talk
            - tomorrow wednesday
            - committee invited, welcome to attend
            - 3 until 4
            - better if like 2 attend
            - `chair` is going
            - it's about sponsorship
            - will talk about next meeting
        - blog
            - `chair` wrote a blog
            - go have a look!
        - open gov
            - couple of things done
            - each role has constitution
            - each person has a note
            - rb president, etc
            - main thing: usefulness of this doc only grows if you keep using it
        
    - ### Vice-Chair Update:
